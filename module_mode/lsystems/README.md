### Python is not my friend

Having just spent a bit of time recently with python (after a long absence), I still have some major gripes with python.

- Four space indent and mixture of tab and space conflict is anal
* Code for ternary select is counter-intuitive and just odd
* So is capitilised `True` and the negation of a boolean is also odd `not Boolean`
* namedtuple or something similar should be part of core
- I should not be feeling pleased with myself to work out how to stringify named tuple

Ruby by contrast is still my friend, it is permissive, like you can create for loops (not that any serious rubyist would do so). It is generally expressive like it is easy to read _cf_ some pythonic code.
